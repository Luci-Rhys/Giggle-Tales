Giggle Tales
This web application will generate illustrations for childrens storybooks. 
Users will prompt the model by providing parts of the story. The model will respond with an image for that part of the story.
The goal of this application is to provide children with the ability to take their stories to the next level by adding images and potentially being able to print their own storybook.
